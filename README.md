<h2>Product Vision:</h2>

<h3>Product Vision Statement</h3>
For adventure seekers and outdoor enthusiasts <br>
Who are looking for a way to find others with similar outdoor interests  <br>
The AdventureQuest application  <br>
is a social connection app <br>
That is free to use without Ads <br>
Unlike the MeetUp application<br>
Our Product is an experience-driven platform  <br>

 <h3>Stakeholders: </h3> 
Outdoor enthusiasts (application users), Company shareholders, Development team, PO, AQ management team, National and local parks and recreation authorities, Social media partners, Partner/sponsor companies 

<h3>Product Vision Board: </h3>

<h3>Near Vision: </h3>

Initial release – Initial product release will include a system for outdoor enthusiasts to connect with others in their area with similar interests. Minimal features will be available upon initial release of the application. These will include creating a profile with activity preferences, an algorithm to show users profiles of other users with similar preferences in a certain area range, the ability for users to “swipe” between potential matches after viewing their profiles, and an ability to message matches.  

<h3>Far Vision: </h3>

Second release – The second release will include a more advanced algorithm with the ability to include further preferences. These will include greater specifics on activities, and companion preferences. The second release will also include a beta of company partnership promotions. This will allow users to receive a discount when participating in an activity from one of the partner companies. Partnerships will allow the application to grow further.  

Third release – The third release will include a finalized version of company partnerships, as well as a more in depth “premium” version of the application. The “premium” version will enhance profiles and matching features to allow for more specific matches.  

<h2>Definition of Ready:</h2>
  
•	Each story has a descriptive title.<br>
  &emsp;•	[What is it part of]: [action for the story], [what is it for]<br>
  &emsp;•	Example: UI: Design UI Prototyping, for the Application<br>
•	User Story opening sentence. <br>
  &emsp;•	As a [role] I want…, so that…<br>
•	Foundational requirements for the story.<br>
•	Additional details for the story.<br>
•	The Story has value to end user. <br>
•	The Story is broken up enough that it can be sized for one sprint. <br>
•	The Story is sized with story points.<br>

<h2>Rationale for how you ordered your backlog:</h2>

Our Projects backlog is organized with dependencies, application workflow, and time in mind. By this we set our tools needed to work on something first in order. Figma is needed to create prototype UI. The prototype UI creation is needed to understand and create the whole login flow, so it must go first. Then, firebase and the backend are needed to create the login page functions and the backend for accounts will take longer to finish than the login UI, so it needs to go before the UI. Then the login UI is needed to create the login feature, so it is ordered next. We are starting with the login flow because it is the first flow the user will see and after is the main page of the application. 

<h1>SPRINT 1</h1>

<h2>Sprint 1 Forecast and Rationale</h2>

Our team forecasted that we could complete 35 story points this sprint. That is almost 6 points per person and is a conservative number of points since this is our first sprint. We have decided that since none of us our familiar with our tech stack that we may run into blockers and should not pull too much into this sprint in case we do have issues. If this sprint goes well, we will consider adding more the next sprint. This is the minimum we felt we could add and still have a working prototype to demo at the end of the sprint.
